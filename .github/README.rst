IoTempower
==========

IoTempower is a framework and environment
for empowering everyone to explore and develop for the
Internet of Things (IoT)
-- tinkerers, makers, programmers, hobbyists, students, artists,
and professionals alike.
It has a special focus on education and is intended to support classes to teach
Internet of Things (IoT) and
home automation.

However, it also supports existing IoT deployments and brings
mechanisms for over the air (OTA) updates and automatic
multi-device deployment. All with a permissible license (and using only
libraries with permissable licenses).

If you are impatient and want to dive into it right now, fast forward to
one of the following:
